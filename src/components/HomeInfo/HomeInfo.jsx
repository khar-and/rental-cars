        Among the services that offer cars for rent in Kyiv and throughout
        Ukraine, ours is distinguished by a truly large fleet. Every car, from a
        Bentley to a budget Daewoo, is inspected immediately before each
        departure, has insurance, is fully functional and perfectly clean.

        Another advantage of Megarent is the low cost of rent, the availability
        of resources and opportunities that meet the requirements of our
        customers, and friendly professional managers.
